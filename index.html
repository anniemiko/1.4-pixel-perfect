          <p class="article-text">I don't understand the question, and I won't respond to it. Steve Holt! Did you enjoy your meal, Mom? You drank it fast enough. Steve Holt!Michael! I'm afraid I just blue myself. Say goodbye to these, because it's the last time! He'll want to use your yacht, and I don't want this thing smelling like fish.</p>
          <p class="article-text">Do a flip! Fry, you can't just sit here in the dark listening to classical music. Good news, everyone! I've taught the toaster to feel love! Daddy Bender, we're hungry. Bender, I didn't know you liked cooking.Yes. You gave me a dollar and some candy. Bender, quit destroying the universe!</p>
          <span href="">text link</span>
          <div class="inset-text">WOAH, THAT'S RADICAL!</div>
          <p class="article-text">But I've never been to the moon! Why yes! Thanks for noticing. For the last time, I don't like lilacs! Your 'first' wife was the one who liked lilacs! Kids have names? Take me to your leader! I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept the lesser title of Zinc Saucier, which I just made up. Uhh… also, comes with double prize money.</p>
          <span>link</span>
          <p>Look, everyone wants to be like Germany, but do we really have the pure strength of 'will'? You're going to do his laundry? No! The cat shelter's on to me. And until then, I can never die?</p>
          <p class="article-text">I am the man with no name, Zapp Brannigan! Is that a cooking show? Of all the friends I've had… you're the first. Interesting. No, wait, the other thing: tedious.</p>
